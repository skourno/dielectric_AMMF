# dielectric_AMMF

An implementation of the augmented modified mean-field (AMMF) theory for the dielectric constant. 

The user can use the routines of the "diel_models" module to conduct dielectric constant calculations using either AMMF or scaled-AMMF (s-AMMF). An example is provided in main.f90.
